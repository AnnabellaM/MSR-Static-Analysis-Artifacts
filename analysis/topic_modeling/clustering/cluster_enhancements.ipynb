This is fine for peephole optimizations defined within Soot itself but is not friendly for users wishing to add their own peephole optimization passes.

That is, protected public(set) string $foo is not allowed.\r\n- [ ] Inheritance - cannot narrow visibility (but set visibility may be omitted if get visibility is wider)\r\n- [ ] If parent is public but only readable (has a get hook and is virtual), a child can do `protected(set)` and add a set hook - `public protected(set) $answer { get => 42; set => print “Why?”; }`\r\n- [ ] virtual properties that have no set operation. If there is no set operation defined on a property, then it is nonsensical to specify a visibility for it. That case will trigger a compile error. For example: public private(set) $answer { get => 42; }\r\n- [ ] Property with asymmetric visibility must have type specified\r\n- [ ] If a virtual property has a set operation and is public, public protected(set) in a child class is invalid\r\n- [ ] Asymmetric visibility is only compatible with properties that have an explicit type specified\r\n- [ ] This functionality applies only to object properties. It does not apply to static properties. - compile time error, if it's even allowed by PHP-Parser grammar\r\n- [ ] Readonly implicitly implies protected(set) - important for inheritance. But the declaration can also explicitly state private(set)\r\n\n\n### Did PHPStan help you today? Did it make you happy in any way?\n\n_No response_",

It would also benefit from this addition\n\nWhat I'm trying to do is similar to this\nhttps://phpstan.org/r/d14df0e7-77ad-41f9-a13b-c09893bf331f\n\nThanks in advance\n\n### Did PHPStan help you today?
